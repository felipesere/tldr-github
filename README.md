# TLDR GitHub

TLDR Github is a small UI to help you keep track of repositories you are interested and give you an overview of activity.

## Background

You can look at your notifications and activity on GitHub, but that can get flooded with stars and other acticity that adds noise.
The intent here is to have a very narrow scope, but provide a high signal-to-noise ratio.

## Roadmap

You can see what I am up to [here](https://github.com/felipesere/tldr-github/projects/2) in the Github Project

## Setup

You will need:
 * make
 * latest stable Rust
 * NodeJS (v13) and npm
 * sqlite3, on Mac via `brew install sqlite3`

If all programs are availabel you should be able to run `make setup` to install any dependencies.

## Thanks

Hopefully [Charlotte](https://github.com/charlottebrf) and [Christoph](https://github.com/christophgockel) will join me!
